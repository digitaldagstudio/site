    <p>Thanksgiving week always comes with a strange mix of excitement, pressure, time blindness, and way too many tiny tasks that all feel urgent. And if you have ADHD? That overwhelm hits even faster. Suddenly the grocery list feels like a thesis project, the travel bag is still empty, and the dog has somehow become extra clingy.</p>

    <p>Before you start spiraling, take a breath. This week does not need to be a sprint or a performance. It can actually feel calm, predictable, and doable — if you keep your to-dos simple.</p>

    <p>That’s why this three-part ADHD-friendly Thanksgiving checklist exists: Must-Dos, Holiday Tasks, and Rest. It’s designed to help you move through the week with structure and compassion — not burnout.</p>

    <h2>1. Must-Dos (Keep It Simple)</h2>
    <p>This is your bare-minimum list — the things that make your daily life functional no matter what chaos is happening around you.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take meds and drink water</li>
      <li>Eat one real meal (not just snacks and coffee)</li>
      <li>Walk the dog and handle basic pet care</li>
      <li>Do one pass through your work email — not perfection, just maintenance</li>
      <li>Keep the house “functional,” not perfect</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This list protects your baseline energy so everything else feels less overwhelming. Doing these items is not “low effort.” It’s maintenance. It’s care. It’s survival. And yes — the bare minimum still counts, especially this week.</p>

    <h2>2. Thanksgiving Tasks (Low-Pressure Edition)</h2>
    <p>Holiday prep doesn’t need to be complicated. These are the basics that help you stay ahead without the anxiety spiral:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a grocery list (cap it at 5–7 items if your brain is overloaded)</li>
      <li>Prep one tiny thing today — even if it’s just choosing a recipe</li>
      <li>Set out your outfit and pack a small essentials bag</li>
      <li>Confirm travel times, hosting details, or what time people are arriving</li>
      <li>Decide on one contribution — store-bought is absolutely valid</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ADHD tip:</strong> batch errands into one single outing. One drive means fewer transitions, fewer decisions, and less overwhelm.</p>

    <h2>3. Rest &amp; Restore (Your Secret Weapon)</h2>
    <p>You cannot productivity-hack your way through a holiday without rest. Your nervous system needs downtime — especially if you’re masking, socializing, or traveling.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take 15–30 minutes completely alone</li>
      <li>Get outside for a low-stimulation walk</li>
      <li>Do one cozy hobby: reading, a show, a puzzle, journaling, or coloring</li>
      <li>Use your “no” muscle when needed — it’s okay to opt out</li>
      <li>Add buffer time between events or errands so you’re not rushing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This category is what prevents burnout. It is not extra or optional — it’s part of how you take care of yourself.</p>

    <h2>Why This To-Do List Works for ADHD Brains</h2>
    <p>ADHD brains crave structure that isn’t overwhelming, short lists, predictability, permission to rest, and small wins that build momentum. Traditional Thanksgiving prep lists tend to be long, chaotic, and built for people with endless energy.</p>
    <p>This three-panel approach keeps the focus narrow and calming. It breaks the week into pieces your brain can actually process and complete.</p>

    <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>
    <p>You do not have to “perform” Thanksgiving. You do not have to keep up with everyone else’s energy. You do not have to be hyper-productive this week.</p>
    <p>You’re already doing your best — and that’s enough.</p>
