    <p>The holidays can be exciting, chaotic, loud… and a lot for our dogs. Between new scents, guests coming and going, cooking noises, and schedule changes, even the most confident pups can feel overwhelmed. And if your dog already struggles with anxiety? Thanksgiving week can feel like a sensory marathon.</p>

    <p>The good news: a simple, predictable walk routine can make <em>all</em> the difference.</p>

    <p>Walks aren’t just “exercise” — they’re grounding, regulating, and soothing for dogs. And during a busy holiday week, walks become your pup’s safest reset button. This gentle three-part routine keeps them calm, confident, and connected to you.</p>

    <h2>🕗 1. Morning Sniff Walk — Burn Off the Jitters</h2>

    <p>Think of this as your dog’s “morning reset.” Thanksgiving week usually starts earlier, gets louder faster, and involves more commotion than normal. A short sniffari is the easiest way to gently drain anxious energy before it builds.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it helps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sniffing resets your dog’s nervous system</li>
      <li>Slow pace lowers cortisol</li>
      <li>Helps avoid pacing, whining, shaking, and clinginess later in the day</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>5–10 minutes</li>
      <li>Let your dog lead the way</li>
      <li>Encourage sniffing, exploring, and slow movement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t a power walk — it’s a calming decompression walk in miniature.</p>

    <h2>🌤 2. Midday Decompression Walk — Especially If Guests Are Over</h2>

    <p>Even friendly dogs can hit a sensory wall around guests, noise, or new environments. This is the moment when anxiety spikes — and when a decompression walk becomes magic.</p>

    <p>If people are over, step outside for a quiet break.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it helps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides distance from overstimulating environments</li>
      <li>Gives your dog a chance to regulate</li>
      <li>Removes the pressure to “be social”</li>
      <li>Prevents overwhelm before it starts</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Walk in the quietest direction</li>
      <li>Focus on a long, loose leash</li>
      <li>Avoid crowded sidewalks</li>
      <li>Let your dog choose the pace</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Think of this walk as a mental reset, not physical exercise.</p>

    <h2>🌙 3. Evening Potty + Calm Down Walk — End the Day Softly</h2>

    <p>By evening, your dog has likely absorbed a <em>lot</em> of sensory input. Even if they seemed fine, their nervous system still needs a cooldown.</p>

    <p><strong>This walk helps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Release last bits of tension</li>
      <li>Prevent bedtime restlessness</li>
      <li>Transition from chaos to calm</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Keep it simple:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Short, slow walk</li>
      <li>Familiar route</li>
      <li>Quiet cues and gentle energy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This puts your dog in the right headspace for sleep — and supports a smoother next day.</p>

    <h2>💛 A Gentle Routine Makes the Week Easier</h2>

    <p>Anxious pups thrive on predictability. This walk routine gives them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structure</li>
      <li>Safe breaks</li>
      <li>Emotional regulation</li>
      <li>A sense of control</li>
      <li>Extra connection with <em>you</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whether you’re hosting, traveling, cooking, or juggling family plans, these small walks help keep your dog grounded throughout the holiday week.</p>

    <p>And the best part? <br><strong>A calmer dog means a calmer you.</strong></p>
