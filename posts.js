    title: "The ADHD Morning Routine That Actually Works (Low-Energy Edition)",
    date: "11/20/2025",
    content: `
      <p>Because some mornings just… require less.</p>

      <p>If you’re someone with ADHD, mornings can feel like a boss battle you didn’t sign up for. Executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and low energy can all stack up before you’ve even opened your eyes. But the truth is: your mornings don’t have to be chaotic or draining. With a simple, predictable routine, you can set up your day in a way that feels effortless and supportive — especially on low-energy days.</p>

      <p>This ADHD-friendly morning routine is designed to be gentle, realistic, and easy to follow, even when motivation is nowhere to be found. No complicated habits. No long checklists. Just small, doable actions that wake up your brain and body without overwhelming you.</p>

      <h3>1. Lights On + 3 Sips of Water</h3>
      <p>Most advice says “chug a full water bottle,” but big tasks in the morning can feel impossible with ADHD. Instead, turn on a light and take three small sips of water. This wakes up your brain gently without requiring willpower.</p>

      <h3>2. Get Dressed First (No Decisions Required)</h3>
      <p>Decision fatigue hits hard in the morning. The trick? Remove decisions entirely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put on your pre-picked outfit</li>
        <li>Use your “default uniform” if choosing feels impossible</li>
        <li>Yesterday’s clean sweatshirt absolutely counts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Getting dressed early builds momentum and signals your brain that the day has started.</p>

      <h3>3. The 2-Minute Bathroom Routine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Brush teeth</li>
        <li>Splash your face or use a face wipe</li>
        <li>Apply deodorant</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just the basics — nothing overwhelming. Anything more is bonus points.</p>

      <h3>4. Meds + Hydration</h3>
      <p>For ADHD brains, “out of sight, out of mind” is real. Place your meds where you can't ignore them — next to your toothbrush, on the counter, or by your water bottle. Pair it with another sip of water to help your brain fully wake up.</p>

      <h3>5. A 30-Second Breakfast</h3>
      <p>Breakfast doesn’t need to be complicated. Choose something fast and easy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toast</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Protein bar</li>
        <li>Yogurt pouch</li>
        <li>Instant oatmeal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. A Tiny Dopamine Hit</h3>
      <p>ADHD brains need a dopamine boost in the morning. Try one of these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play a favorite song</li>
        <li>Wear a cute accessory</li>
        <li>Do a quick stretch</li>
        <li>Pet your emotional support animal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Routine Works</h3>
      <p>This routine is built on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-friction tasks</li>
        <li>Minimal decisions</li>
        <li>Predictability</li>
        <li>Quick wins to build momentum</li>
        <li>Micro-rewards that boost motivation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instead of fighting your brain, this routine works with it — making your mornings smoother, calmer, and more achievable.</p>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>You’re not lazy or bad at mornings. Your brain just works differently. This routine helps you start your day gently and successfully — even on low-energy days.</p>

    title: "ADHD Weekend Reset",
    date: "11/22/2025",
    content: `
     <p>If weekends leave you feeling overwhelmed, behind, or unsure where to start, you’re not alone. For ADHD brains, two days “off” don’t always mean rest. Sometimes they turn into a blur of intentions, unfinished chores, and guilt about everything you didn’t get done.</p>

    <p>But here’s the truth: <strong>You don’t need to catch up. You don’t need to finish everything. You just need to breathe — and reset gently.</strong></p>

    <p>This soft ADHD Weekend Reset is designed for <strong>low-energy days</strong>, <strong>executive dysfunction</strong>, and anyone craving a calmer start to the week. It’s simple, flexible, and completely shame-free.</p>

    <p>Let’s make Monday feel kinder — one tiny step at a time. 🌿</p>

    <h2>1. Pick One Thing Only</h2>
    <p>Not the whole list. Not everything you’ve been avoiding. Just <strong>one</strong> small task that makes Monday feel lighter.</p>

    <p>Some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear one surface</li>
      <li>Start a load of laundry</li>
      <li>Take trash out or put it by the door</li>
      <li>Reset your entryway</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t about productivity — it’s about removing friction.</p>

    <p><strong>ADHD Tip:</strong> When you limit yourself to one thing, your brain stops resisting. You may even naturally do more (and if you don’t? Still a win).</p>

    <h2>2. Reset Your Space (5–10 Minutes)</h2>
    <p>Your home doesn’t need a deep clean. It just needs to breathe.</p>

    <p>Try a micro-reset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make your bed</li>
      <li>Gather dishes into the sink</li>
      <li>Throw away the obvious trash</li>
      <li>Open blinds or crack a window</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A tiny environmental shift can create a huge mental shift — especially for ADHD brains that feel clutter visually and emotionally.</p>

    <h2>3. Reset Your Brain</h2>
    <p>Weekends get messy inside your head too — tasks, thoughts, little worries, random ideas.</p>

    <p>A gentle brain reset can look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewing next week’s calendar</li>
      <li>Planning just 2–3 meals</li>
      <li>Doing a 2-minute brain dump</li>
      <li>Highlighting only what’s truly important</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t “planning your life.” It’s just clearing mental static so your brain can exhale.</p>

    <h2>4. Reset Your Body</h2>
    <p>A regulated nervous system supports everything else. Treat your body like it deserves softness.</p>

    <p>Try one or two:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A long shower</li>
      <li>Lotion + comfy clothes</li>
      <li>Hydrate</li>
      <li>Step outside for 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Stretch slowly</li>
      <li>Put on fresh bedding</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t self-care aesthetic — it’s nervous-system care.</p>

    <h2>5. Reset Your Joy</h2>
    <p>Your weekend reset doesn’t end with chores. It ends with something that fills you.</p>

    <p>Choose anything that feels warm or grounding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tea, knitting, journaling, or drawing</li>
      <li>A show you genuinely love (not just background noise)</li>
      <li>A slow sniff-walk with your dog</li>
      <li>Listening to music you loved in middle school</li>
      <li>Curling up under a blanket</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal is to make Sunday feel like comfort, not pressure.</p>

    <h2>Low-Energy Version</h2>
    <p>If you’re tired, overwhelmed, or frozen in place, do <strong>half of a step.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fold 2 pieces of laundry</li>
      <li>Bring one cup to the sink</li>
      <li>Make part of the bed</li>
      <li>Do a 60-second brain dump</li>
      <li>Drink a few sips of water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Half a step still counts. Half a step still helps. Half a step is still progress.</p>

    <h2>A Kinder Start to Your Week</h2>
    <p>This routine isn’t about productivity — it’s about peace. It’s about shrinking the Sunday Scaries, lowering the pressure, and giving your ADHD brain exactly what it needs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clarity</li>
      <li>Comfort</li>
      <li>Structure</li>
      <li>Softness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don’t have to earn rest. You don’t have to complete everything. You just have to show up gently for yourself.</p>

    <p>And that’s enough. Always. 🌿</p>
