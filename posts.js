      <p>Because some mornings just… require less.</p>

      <p>If you’re someone with ADHD, mornings can feel like a boss battle you didn’t sign up for. Executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and low energy can all stack up before you’ve even opened your eyes. But the truth is: your mornings don’t have to be chaotic or draining. With a simple, predictable routine, you can set up your day in a way that feels effortless and supportive — especially on low-energy days.</p>
      
      <p>This ADHD-friendly morning routine is designed to be gentle, realistic, and easy to follow, even when motivation is nowhere to be found. No complicated habits. No long checklists. Just small, doable actions that wake up your brain and body without overwhelming you.</p>

      <h3>1. Lights On + 3 Sips of Water</h3>
      <p>Most advice says “chug a full water bottle,” but big tasks in the morning can feel impossible with ADHD. Instead, turn on a light and take three small sips of water. This wakes up your brain gently without requiring willpower.</p>

      <h3>2. Get Dressed First (No Decisions Required)</h3>
      <p>Decision fatigue hits hard in the morning. The trick? Remove decisions entirely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put on your pre-picked outfit</li>
        <li>Use your “default uniform” if choosing feels impossible</li>
        <li>Yesterday’s clean sweatshirt absolutely counts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Getting dressed early builds momentum and signals your brain that the day has started.</p>

      <h3>3. The 2-Minute Bathroom Routine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Brush teeth</li>
        <li>Splash your face or use a face wipe</li>
        <li>Apply deodorant</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just the basics — nothing overwhelming. Anything more is bonus points.</p>

      <h3>4. Meds + Hydration</h3>
      <p>For ADHD brains, “out of sight, out of mind” is real. Place your meds where you can't ignore them — next to your toothbrush, on the counter, or by your water bottle. Pair it with another sip of water to help your brain fully wake up.</p>

      <h3>5. A 30-Second Breakfast</h3>
      <p>Breakfast doesn’t need to be complicated. Choose something fast and easy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toast</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Protein bar</li>
        <li>Yogurt pouch</li>
        <li>Instant oatmeal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. A Tiny Dopamine Hit</h3>
      <p>ADHD brains need a dopamine boost in the morning. Try one of these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play a favorite song</li>
        <li>Wear a cute accessory</li>
        <li>Do a quick stretch</li>
        <li>Pet your emotional support animal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Routine Works</h3>
      <p>This routine is built on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-friction tasks</li>
        <li>Minimal decisions</li>
        <li>Predictability</li>
        <li>Quick wins to build momentum</li>
        <li>Micro-rewards that boost motivation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instead of fighting your brain, this routine works with it — making your mornings smoother, calmer, and more achievable.</p>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>You’re not lazy or bad at mornings. Your brain just works differently. This routine helps you start your day gently and successfully — even on low-energy days.</p>
